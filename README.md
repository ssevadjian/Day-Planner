## Day Planner

A standard work day calendar contains timeblocks from 9am - 6pm.
When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
When you scroll down, the time blocks are color-coded as gray for time that has past, blue for time that is present, and faded blue/teal for time in the future.
When I click 'Add' on a timeblock, a modal window opens for me to save an event.
Event is saved to localStorage.
When I refresh the page, any saved events persist.
